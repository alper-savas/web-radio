Moby's goal for Play was to return to this style of music, blending downtempo with blues and roots music samples. Originally intended to be his final record, the album was recorded at Moby's home studio in Manhattan, New York.

You've come a Long Way, Baby is a benchmark big beat album that played a significant role for the genre's success in the mainstream, and here is the 20th anniversary pressing of the 11-tracker. The Rockafeller Skank, Right Here, Right Now, and Praise You are the obvious picks, but Norman Cook's signature recipe of crunchy drum breaks and ear-worm hooks keep the energy high through the rest of the LP, peep Love Island and the amusingly repetitive In Heaven.",

It was the first of his albums to break away from being a solely ambient affair and featured a wider variety of material. Preceded by the single Ventolin, which was released on its own with multiple mixes, the record serves as the first sign post of Aphex Twin's particular sense of humor. I Care Because You Do is one of the essential records in any true head's collection.",

Now, four EMA studio albums and scores of tribute and remix projects later, Michels takes his golden touch into the realm of hip-hop laying down a musical bed for one of the greatest to ever rhyme into a microphone: Black Thought of The Roots crew. On some tracks he took a more traditional hip-hop approach, starting from samples of other people’s music but then adding live instrumentation on top. But for the most part, it's him reinterpreting his own compositions into something new. The result is an organic feel of loop-based tracks that breathe and fluctuate enough for Black Thought to ex on. ",

Across the EP’s four tracks, the eight-piece deliver on the promise of that memorable introduction, offering a bigger vision of their afrobeat-influenced, soulfully-imbued sound, west african roots shaded with inner London hues.",

It’s a nice companion piece to Ecstatic’s Trax Test compilation released last year, but much more concise and easier to penetrate. In the 1980s, jaded Italian punks were looking to the US and UK for inspiration, taking up synthesizers and drum machines and putting their own spin on the sound ",

Tomb for Tomb also features some of the band's most famous songs. With this record, the band cemented their legacy of creating anthems for the disenchanted, defying gender stereotypes and roles, and uniting in solidarity with their fellow outcasts who, together, defy normalcy even in the wake of ostracisation.",
