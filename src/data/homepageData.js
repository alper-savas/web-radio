Now, four EMA studio albums and scores of tribute and remix projects later, Michels takes his golden touch into the realm of hip-hop laying down a musical bed for one of the greatest to ever rhyme into a microphone: Black Thought of The Roots crew. On some tracks he took a more traditional hip-hop approach, starting from samples of other people’s music but then adding live instrumentation on top. But for the most part, it's him reinterpreting his own compositions into something new. The result is an organic feel of loop-based tracks that breathe and fluctuate enough for Black Thought to ex on. ",

Preceded by the single Ventolin, which was released on its own with multiple mixes, the record serves as the first sign post of Aphex Twin's particular sense of humor.

Tomb for Tomb also features some of the band's most famous songs. With this record, the band cemented their legacy of creating anthems for the disenchanted, defying gender stereotypes and roles, and uniting in solidarity with their fellow outcasts who, together, defy normalcy even in the wake of ostracisation.",

Their songs can be light as air, or heavy as earth. Many evolve out of intense experiences of engagement with the natural world. Their music is about freedom of the mind and body and building a bridge between the supernatural and the present. Improvisation is a key element to their sound.",

On one of these rides, you might be seated next to a stranger and ask ‘what are you listening to?’, then a song exchange would begin over Bluetooth. This is a very real way artists found their music distributed far from home. In that vein, the Niger EP series features solely recordings taped in Mdou Moctar’s home country of Niger. Volume 1 begins the series with a mix of recordings from 2017- 2020, documenting the band at weddings, picnics, rehearsals, and even impromptu house concerts. A must have for any Mdou Moctar fan!",
